# Notes
* Long Position - Buy
* Short Position - Sell

# Bid-Ask Spreads
* Party A is willing to sell at £7
* Party B is willing to buy at £10
* Maker will buy from Party A at £7
* Maker will sell from Party B at £10
* Maker makes a profit of £3. 
  * The difference between these two, the spread, is the principal transaction cost of trading (outside commissions),
  * The spread may widen significantly if fewer participants place limit orders to buy a 
  security (thus generating fewer bid prices) or if fewer sellers place limit orders to sell.

# Spot Trading
* Involves directly purchasing or selling financial instruments and assets such as cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, bonds.
* Delivery of the asset is immediate.
* Spot trading occurs in spot markets eg either exchange based or over-the-counter.
* Benefits only from rising prices

# Derivatives Trading
* Financial contracts set between two or more parties. 
* Its a bet on the future price movement of an asset
* Trader would never become the owner of the underlying asset
* Trader doesn't pay a price
  * He/She needs to post margin to collateralize (potential) cash settlement obligations
  * Post Margin: This means depositing or providing collateral, which could be cash, securities, or other assets. 
    The margin acts as a financial safeguard or guarantee.
  * Collateralize:  To collateralize means to provide something of value (the margin, in this case) as security for a 
    potential obligation. If the obligation isn't met, the collateral can be used to cover the loss.
  * Cash Settlement Obligations: This refers to a requirement to make a cash payment at the end of a financial transaction.
  * Margin Requirement is typically (much) less then the price of the underlying
* High leverage could mean high gain or loss
  * Leverage: Leverage involves using borrowed money to amplify the potential return on an investment. For example, if you 
    have $10,000 and borrow $90,000 to invest $100,000, your leverage is 10:1. 
  * High Risk: When you use high leverage, your potential returns are magnified because you're investing a larger amount. 
  * However, the same leverage also magnifies potential losses. If the investment declines in value, you could lose more than 
    your initial investment and still owe money. 
  * For example:
    * If the investment gains 10%, a highly leveraged position can result in a very high return on the original capital. 
    Conversely, if the investment loses 10%, the losses can exceed the amount of the initial investment, leading to significant financial risk.
* Example: Futures, CFD (Contract for difference)
* CFD orders are placed directly at the exchange

# Forex
* ECN vs STP
  * ECN: ECN stands for 'Electronic Communication Network' which is simply a technical term that is used to describe how banks and liquidity 
  providers connect to each other to form a bid and offer price. In the Forex industry, it can be used to identify providers who use this 
  type of pricing mechanism in order to offer raw interbank pricing to retail traders. Under this model your broker will stream raw prices and 
  your trades will be offset with another client, a liquidity provider or held internally by the broker. This usually results in faster trade execution. 
  This is distinct from order execution that may result in an offsetting order placed with a liquidity provider.

  * STP: This term stands for 'Straight Through Processing' and is used when a Forex and CFD provider processes all trades at market prices 
  obtained from a liquidity provider, this price is simply passed on by the broker. This is not dissimilar to the ECN pricing model in that the 
  price is not altered and there is no dealing desk intervention when the trade is processed, hence it is known as STP.

# Keep an eye on following factors affecting oil prices
 * Interest rates change
   * Lower interest rates -> Weaker Dollar -> Raising Oil prices due to demand -> Also could cause higher speculative investment in oil futures
 * Rising Inflation - Higher oil prices
 * Supply factors

# Factors affecting Oil prices
* Interest rate cuts in the U.S. typically influence oil prices through several economic channels:
  * **Impact on the U.S. Dollar:**
     - **Weaker Dollar**: Lower interest rates tend to weaken the U.S. dollar because it reduces the returns investors get from holding 
       dollar-denominated assets. 
     - Since oil is priced in dollars, a weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for buyers holding other currencies, often increasing demand and, 
       therefore, raising oil prices.
  * **Economic Growth and Demand for Oil:**
    * **Stimulating Economic Growth**: Lower interest rates usually stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses
      * This increased economic activity can boost energy consumption, particularly in industries like transportation and manufacturing 
        leading to higher oil demand and prices.
  * **Inflation Expectations:**
    - **Rising Inflation**: Rate cuts can also increase inflation expectations because they promote spending and investment. Higher 
      inflation tends to increase commodity prices, including oil, as investors seek to protect against eroding purchasing power.
  * **Investment in Commodities:**
   - **Speculation and Investment Shifts**: Lower interest rates reduce the returns on bonds and other fixed-income investments, potentially 
     making commodities like oil more attractive. This can result in more speculative investment in oil futures, pushing prices higher.
  * **Global Oil Demand:**
   - **Impact on Global Growth**: The U.S. is a key player in the global economy, and its monetary policy has international repercussions. 
     Rate cuts in the U.S. can boost global economic activity, increasing worldwide oil demand, which in turn can drive up oil prices.

### Caveats:
   - **Supply Side Factors**: While interest rate cuts generally support higher oil prices through increased demand and a weaker dollar, 
  supply-side factors, such as production levels set by OPEC or geopolitical disruptions, can counter or reinforce these effects.
